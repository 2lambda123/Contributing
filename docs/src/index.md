# Contributing

## Welcome!

This documentation lays out the guidelines and some tutorials for
Biologists, Bioinformaticians, and Computational Biologists, who want to contribute to the BioJulia community.

This documentation is split into two broad categories.

The first section, called "How do I...?" contains a set of simple walkthrough
style guides for contributing in different ways.

The second section, called "Policies and Guidelines". This section contains
the agreed on policies that members, maintainers, and administrators are expected
to adhere to.  

BioJulia welcomes contributions in several forms including through Github Pull
Requests, through opening Github Issues, and through package submissions.
BioJulia welcomes contributions of all kinds to the community, this includes but
is not limited to code contributions.

Take a look through the articles in the "How do I...?" section to get started.
