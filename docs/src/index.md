## Welcome!

This documentation lays out the guidelines and some tutorials for
Biologists, Bioinformaticians, and Computational Biologists, who want to contribute to the BioJulia community.

This documentation is split into two broad categories.

The first section, called "Contribution Guides" contain a set of walkthrough
style guides for contributing in different ways.

The second section, called "Policies and Guidelines". This section contains
the agreed on policies members, maintainers, and administrators are expected to

Requests, through opening Github Issues, and through package submissions.
BioJulia welcomes contributions of all kinds to the community, this includes but
