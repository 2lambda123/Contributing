# [Incident Response](@id incident_response)

If a member, or maintainer, of BioJulia breaks the code of conduct, and you
are the target of harassing or otherwise bad behaviour, you may immediately
report the incident to one of the admin maintainers of BioJulia.

When making a report to admin, you should be as descriptive as possible, and
be as objective as possible to help the admin responsibly handle the incident.
Be accurate in your report as to the actual events, if possible, collect screen
shots and other lines of evidence which cannot be denied.

## Example report

* Reported by: Mike
* Who: Chris G (@creepius, creepius@hotmail.com)
* When: October 2015
* What Happened: Chris made an inappropriate comment and made _ad hominem_
insults to other member's intelligence during what was previously a technical discussion.
* Additional Context: NA
* Ongoing: No

The admin members must make an email address available to the
BioJulia community members, through which they can be contacted.
Report the incident to the admin members.
They will keep a a copy of your report confidential.

## Responding to reports

When responding to a report, an admin will:

* State they have recieved a report of a code of conduct issue.
* State when and where it happened.
* Give a general description of what happened (**The name of the reporter must not be revealed**).
* State the consequences.
* State what is expected of the person now.

When responding to reports, admins pledge to:

* Focus on recording the details, and not on their individual judgement.
* Record what they're hearing from the people affected.
* Record it.
* Assume reports are credible.

### Judging the risk and impact of incidents

When deciding on the severity of a report, an admin must
consider:

* How many people are affected?
* Was this in public or private?
* Are there any spill over effects.

When deciding the risk associated with a report, and admin must consider:

* Medical or legal requirements.
* Repeat offenders.
* How dangerous is it for the incident to happen again.

The following example table can be used to asses the risk and impact of incidents:

|  | Low Risk | High Risk |
|-------------|-------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|
| Low Impact | Inappropriate jokes made in private | Member has previous reputation for online harassment |
| High Impact | Constant inappropriate jokes | Persistent co-ordinated harassment |

### Determining the response to an incident.

Admins may use the following example table to help them decide on the
appropriate action to take following an incident report.

|  | Low Risk | High Risk |
|-------------|----------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Low Impact | Verbal warning | Take notes and follow up later |  |  |
| High Impact | Public apology | Co-Ordinated whole team response: Removal of member from pages and positions of responsibility. Possible block from group entirely. |

If a member with a degree of responsibility and administrative privileges is the
offender, they may be [off-boarded](@ref off_boarding) without the required
notification period. This is to prevent the offending individual from abusing
their position and retaliating against anyone they think made a report.

## Following up after acting on an incident

Following an incident, after the admin has issued appropriate action, they must
follow up with the individual(s) that made the report. This means letting the
affected individual that made the report know the following:

1. Was a code of conduct breach found.
2. What was the response of the admin (e.g. reprimand, or more severe consequence.)
3. Anything further that needs to be discussed.
