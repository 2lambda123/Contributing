# Joining the BioJulia GitHub Organisation

If you would like to be added to the BioJulia GitHub organisation,
you may ask the current owners to add you.

They will generally be willing to do so if you have done one or
more of the following:

1. You have registered a new package under BioJulia.
2. [A fix of a bug.](policy/pull_requests.md)
3. [Performance improvements of existing code.](policy/pull_requests.md)
4. [New code and additional functionality.](policy/pull_requests.md)
5. [Additional and improved unit tests of existing code.](policy/pull_requests.md)
6. [Additional or improved documentation of existing code and packages.](policy/pull_requests.md)

None of these "requirements" are set in stone,
but we prefer you to have done one or more of the above, as it
gives good confidence that you are familiar with the process of
filing-bugs/surfacing-issues/providing-documentation/reviewing-pull-requests,
and are willing to do so.
Any other avenue for demonstrating commitment to the community and the
GitHub organisation will be considered.
